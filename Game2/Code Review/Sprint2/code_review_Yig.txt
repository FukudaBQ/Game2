A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:

Specific comments on code quality
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
If we want to add one more state of link such as holding shield. The code could easily support that change by adding a new method called holdingShield. 
And the holdingShield can be easily called in the Player class.
