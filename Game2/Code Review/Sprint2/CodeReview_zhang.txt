Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 

All the variables and method have meaningful names. Code in each method is highly readable with variable names and method names.
However, many magic numbers are used. Although these numbers are understanable with their variable names, it's always better to define these numbers first and avoid using magic numbers.

Specific comments on code quality
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
The class is used to reset the game. However, for now, we only need to reset the player location, and it worked well. 
If we want to reset other status of player, such as player's life, the current implementation could easily support that change since resetCommand method take the player class as its paremeter.
However,  the current implementation may not support reseting the other classes like enemies, since resetCommand method only take the player class as its paremeter.
