Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 
Good thing is that we can easily know what each method does.
However, it is a little bit confusing to read that switch statement. How each fireball moves is kind of hard to understand.

Specific comments on code quality: The code is easy for maintainability. If we want to change the radius, health, and movement speed, we can just change
the variables, which is convenient.
