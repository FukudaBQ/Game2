Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 

All the variables and method have meaningful names. The readability of code is really high.
However, there are some magic numbers, for example 1000, which is hard to read.

Specific comments on code quality
The part Hangyu did is player's death, when player's health equals 0, the player starts to spin, and the game won't update.
But the code only does one function, also he put this function into the main class, which is kind of hard to find.
