Specific comments on code quality: neat implementation of camera focus using array
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change: it's easy to work with with different maps. Each room in map can be extracted into the array, thus can use these files (CamMoveUp.cs, CamMoveDown.cs,CamMoveRight.cs, CamMoveLeft.cs) to work with.
