Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 

All the variables and method have meaningful names. Code in each method is highly readable with variable names and method names.
However, most methods in this class are same with the methods in the item class which is used to manage the most of item classes including fairy class. Therefore, It's a little bit confusing that Huangyu writing come repeating methods here to make this class unclear.

Specific comments on code quality
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
The class is used to handle collisions in the game. In the future, we are going to add the collisions between projectiles, the player and enemies. 
The collisions of projectiles and the player will be easily supported by this class since this class can see player class and its statemachine.
However, the current implementation could not easily support collisions of enemies since this class does not see any enemy classes.
