In this program, you can use WASD or arrow to control the sprite which is link. Then you can use 1, 2, 3 to use projectiles. In order to use sword, you can press Z or N.
Then you can press T, Y, U, I, O to change the state of enemies. Lastly, use q to quit, use R to reset the game.
Bugs: 1. After using Z or N to use sword, and pressing 1,2, or 3 to use projectiles, the projectiles will stay at player's location.
	  2. When walk close to those four blocks on the map, sometimes the link can't move. So we need to use some other direction keys to walk through the space between blocks.
